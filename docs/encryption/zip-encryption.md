# How to Encrypt and Use a Compressed Image in an Android App

## Overview
This guide explains how to add a compressed and password-protected image inside an Android app and use it as a background in an XML layout.

## Steps

### 1. Compress and Encrypt the Image
Use a library like `Zip4j` to compress and encrypt your image file:

```java
ZipFile zipFile = new ZipFile("path/to/compressed.zip", "password".toCharArray());
zipFile.addFile(new File("path/to/your_image.png"));
```

### 2. Add the Compressed File to the Project
Place the compressed file inside the `assets` directory of your Android project.

### 3. Decompress the File at Runtime
In your Java/Kotlin code, decompress the file at runtime when needed:

```java
ZipFile zipFile = new ZipFile(getFilesDir() + "/compressed.zip", "password".toCharArray());
zipFile.extractAll(getFilesDir() + "/extracted/");
```

### 4. Load and Use the Image Programmatically
After decompressing the file, load the image using `Drawable.createFromPath()` and set it as a background:

```java
Drawable background = Drawable.createFromPath(getFilesDir() + "/extracted/your_image.png");
View layout = findViewById(R.id.yourLayout);
layout.setBackground(background);
```

### 5. Setting Background in XML
You cannot directly use the image in XML. Instead, set the background programmatically in your activity or fragment:

```java
// Background setting is done programmatically in Java/Kotlin
```

### 6. Run the Application
Upon running the application, the image will be decompressed and set as the background for the specified layout.

## Summary
This process ensures that the image remains protected inside the APK and is only accessible within the app, where it can be used as intended.


## Library Used
